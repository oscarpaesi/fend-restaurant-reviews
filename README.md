# Restaurant Reviews

A restaurant review application, with reviews for a few restaurants in New York City.

The application was built to be responsive and mobile-ready, besides providing accesibility features for screen readers and a Service Worker to cache resources to make them available offline. The maps provided by [leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) with [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/).

This is a project assignment for [Udacity's][udacity] [Front End Web Developer Nanodegree][fend].
The base for the project, containing visual assets and a simple game engine is available at [this repository][assignment-repo].

# How to use it
You can access the application from your browser, by clicking [here][github-page].

If you want to run it locally, you will need an HTTP server. I suggest [http-server][http-server], which you can install with:
```sh
$ npm install http-server -g
```

Then run it from the project folder with:
```sh
$ http-server
```

The application will then be available at `http://localhost:8080/`
